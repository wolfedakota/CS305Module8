8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
**
Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. Artemis financial wanted to modernize their operations by using the most current and effective software security.

**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
**
When vulnerabilities were found they were assessed to find the best possible solution. Sometimes a different version of software needed to be used. Other times the code needed to be refactored. Code security is highly valuable in maintaining the integrity of various data, as well as maintaing the trust from the consumer base.

**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
**
The vulnerablity assessment was helpful in identifying weak points, learning what could happen if that weak point was exposed, and how to prevent that exposure from happening. Trying to suppress a large amount of false positives can be tedious.

**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
**
Layers of security were increased by using AES, SHA-256, Certificates, and the OWASP dependency check. I would use the OWASP dependency check to assess vulnerabilities.

**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
**
I ran the OWASP dependency check before and after the code was refactored to ensure no new vulnerabilities were present.

**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
**
The OWASP dependency check seems like a very useful tool that I would like to use in my personal projects going forward.

**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
**
I would show them the refactored code I used to utilize the deploy cipher.
